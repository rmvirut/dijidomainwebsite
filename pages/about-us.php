				<p>
					We're a small tech firm based in Halifax that offers a diverses array of technical services to individuals and businesses who requrie assistance with technology. Most of our talent comes from young, up and coming deveopers, software engineers, programmers, systems administrators etc that are either at the beginning of their tertiary programs or at the end but have a proven desire to improve their skill and become better in their respective fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					At present, we have no physical office space but we can be reached on our facebook page, through our website's contact form, by email, phone or through the post to the address provided on our <a href="./pages/contact-us.php" target="_blank">contact</a> page.
				</p>
				<h3>Our Reason</h3>
				<p>
					Since the turn of the 21st Century, technology has rapidly become vital to our individual lives. More importantly, it's become critical to anyone looking to succeed in business. All aspects of day-to-day business including payments, accounting, content management, inventory, HR management, marketing, email and networking, communication (etc.) systems have become entirely software-based.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, as ubiquitous as technology has become in the digital age, busy professionals donâ€™t necessarily have the time to learn new skills to take full advantage, let alone leverage, the potential of free open source technology available to them.
