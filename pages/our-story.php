                <h4>The Past</h4>
                <p>
                    During September 2016 while taking a course in business management at Saint Mary’s University, a project was assigned to setup a simple two-day business venture with no more than $1 investment. Up until then, I had always had the idea of starting a company
                    that would provide open-source software alternatives to small businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Equipped with two years in computing science and 6-year long passion for technology, I had become well informed about a lot of software and their inner workings. However, I was reluctant to start because I didn’t have the time to investigate the industry
                    thoroughly because school kept me busy and I was afraid; but this was my opportunity to not only get my idea of running an open-source dependent IT company off the ground, but I could make it part of school and get some advice from
                    my professor who was an experienced entrepreneur. And after some time praying, I finally overcame that fear by God's grace.
                </p>
                <h4>The Present</h4>
                <p>
                    I did my research, drew up a business plan and got the 2-day venture running on <b><em>September 26, 2016</em></b>, first as a PC repair company and then later expanded to web development amongst others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in the beginning, idea that led to Diji Domain was put to the test; <b>Starting and operating a business with no capital for IT</b>. It's ironic that an IT company wouldn't have money for IT but this goes to prove that our
                    idea is not only tested but works and it can work for any business if there's commitment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Long story short, I didn’t even need the $1 investment I was restricted in the end, got an A+ on the course and, if you’re reading this, kept the business running beyond the two days it was required to operate. I’ve managed to start an entire company
                    using 0$. Since then we’ve (now a team of four and still increasing) worked with clients from all walks of life and several industries.
                </p>
                <h4>The Future</h4>
                <p>
                    More hands also mean we’ve increased our talent pool, especially, in website and mobile applications development. And we're looking to improve our business IT development and support sector as well as start building our own custom products tailored for
                    our clientele.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By God’s grace we’ve come a long way from a humble one-man pc repair gig. But we won’t forget that offering technical support to small businesses and individuals is still at the core of our business and we hope to serve small and medium businesses within
                    [and without] the Maritimes for a long time to come.</p>
                <p>
                    Thanks for your time and we hope to get the chance to work with you.<br> - Kojo Acquah, Founder/Manager/Friend of God
