                <dt>What is open-source software?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Open source software is a kind of licensing which allows a software/program to be used/modified
                    as much as the user wants. There are several types of open sources licenses each specifying the
                    level of freedom one has to modify a program
                </dd>
                <dt>What are the downsides of going open source instead of proprietary</dt>
                <dd>
                    Both proprietary and open source software have their ups and downs. On one hand, open source is
                    often cheaper to acquire and modify plus you have the advantage of full control but on the other
                    hand it is often harder to implement due to lack of clear documentation and /or professional
                    assitance. Proprietary software on the other hand is easier to implement plus most licenses come
                    with support from the manufacturer. However, these licenses have time limits and there's also the
                    cost of purchase and renewal
                </dd>
                <dt>Do you work with proprietary software at all?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes, there are certain scenarios that require that a propritary software be purchased. However, due
                    to the boom in opensource programs, this has become very unlikely. The only instances we would
                    recommend this is if we're aware that the opensource version is unavailable or far too
                    underdeveloped/risky to use.
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I know if there's an opensource solution to the challenge my business faces?</dt>

            <h4>About our service(s) and our company</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, due to past experiences, we are compelled to make the following regarding Diji Domain,
                its employees and services clear to all current and future clients:</p>
            <dl class="dl-bold">
                <dt>We are NOT a cheap alternative to professional IT services</dt>
                <dd>
                    The fact that we are a student-owned and operated company has led a few of our clients to try taking
                    advantage of this. Please be aware that although we promise a more affordable solution to IT, we do
                    not guarantee any level of cost savings.
                </dd>
                <dt>We are NOT trying to gain professional experience</dt>
                <dd>
                    Though experience in the field is invaluable to every student, especially in the computing sciences,
                    Diji Domain's primary goal is to offer IT services and develop more talent. This means that we <b>won't</b>
                    be working for free "to gain exposure". We have in-house projects that we do to handle that aspect
                    of the business.
                </dd>
                <dt>We do NOT work/offer services in exchange for "stocks or shares" in your business</dt>
                <dd>
                    Although we wish your business the best and truly hope it succeeds, it's not a feasible for us to
                    work in exchange for equity. This is a privilege that is reserved exclusively for our diji dev team
                    members who may have ideas and would like some help implementing them.
                    <br> But on rare occasion, we may consider this, espeically if the applicant is a student. This
                    decision yet to be finalized and made available.
